PROJECT TITLE: "Programming Exercise: Object Oriented Caesar Cipher"

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To understand basic mechanics of Object Oriented Programming
                    in exactity, to rewrite previous Caesar Cipher Encryption
                    and Decryption algorithms in OOP manner (make use of instance 
                    variables, encapsulation, constructors etc.).
                    Assignment 1 - One Key
                    task 1 - Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption
                    using one Key
                    task 2 - Caesar Cipher decryption by the use of Frequency Analysis
                    Assignment 2 - Two Keys
                    task 1 - Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption
                    using two keys
                    task 2 - Caesar Cipher decryption by the use of Frequency Analysis

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Use BlueJ Environment to open project named "package.bluej". 
                           Find inside of this project 4 classes: 
                           CaesarCipher (algorithm that uses 1 key encryption and decryption) 
                           TestCaesarCipher - compile, create object of type TestCaesarCipher 
                           and start the function: 
                           "SimpleTests" for task 1 and 2; 
                           CaesarCipherTwo (algorithm that uses 2 keys encryption and 
                           decryption) 
                           TestCaesarCipherTwo - compile, create object of type 
                           TestCaesarCipherTwo and start the function: 
                           "SimpleTests" for task 1 and 2;
                           You will be required to choose one txt file, first of all, for encryption
                           and, after that, encrypted message will be decrypted. You can modify 
                           TestCaesarCipher and TestCaesarCipherTwo files to do only one of the above
                           functions. You may choose from available in example files.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: you will need library: "edu.duke.FileResource"
                   (simplified version of File function from Java)
